# Movie-prediction
Description: Based on the massive movie information, it would be interesting to understand what are the important factors that make a movie more successful than others. So, we would like to analyze what kind of movies are more successful, in other words, get higher score. We also want to show the results of this analysis in an intuitive way by visualizing outcome using ggplot2 in R.
In this project, we take scores as response variable and focus on operating predictions by analyzing the rest of variables in the  given movie data. The results can help film companies to understand the secret of generating a commercial success movie.
